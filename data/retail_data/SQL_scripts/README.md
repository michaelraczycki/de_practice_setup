This folder contains the files necesary for creating a set of db tables that can be used for SQL practice. In my case I've decided to go with
dockerised version of the PostgreSQL so if you wish to have the same setup, you need to adjust the shared volume line in docker-compose.yml in order for your pgadmin to see the .sql files and enable you to select and execute them.
